### Setting up qadence in development mode

We recommend to use the [`hatch`](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/) environment manager to install `qadence_protocols` from source:

```bash
python -m pip install hatch

# get into a shell with all the dependencies
python -m hatch shell

# run a command within the virtual environment with all the dependencies
python -m hatch run python my_script.py
```

**WARNING**
`hatch` will not combine nicely with other environment managers such as Conda. If you still want to use Conda,
install it from source using `pip`:

```bash
# within the Conda environment
python -m pip install -e .
```
